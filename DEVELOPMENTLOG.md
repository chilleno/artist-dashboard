# Development log

## 1 - Project preparation

This step was made by myself with no AI help as is not needed for the fundations. 

- Installed [Next.js + Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next) from terminal with: pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
- Added the MCP for magicuidesign to easily ask agent to add Magic UI components to add animations. 
- Added the MCP for Shadcn to avoid mistakes creating ui with Shadcn.
- Added the Google Chrome MCP to better debug with the agent. 
- Installed [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) to manage states

## 2 - Adding Global Context

This step I prepare a file called CONTEXT.md to give the agents a global context that helps to understand the fundations, objective and what to do and what to avoid during the development process. I will not add more to this step because it can be readed directly in that file what I did here. 


## 3 - creating project structure and adding mock data

In this step we create the base directory structure added to CONTEXT.md and README.md
also asked the agent using the Chrome MCP to get data from [songstats.com](https://songstats.com) and added it to a json file using the next prompt ðŸ‘‡
<pre>
Goal:get data from [songstats.com](https://songstats.com) and added it to a json file 
AI Tool Used: copilot + chrome mcp

Prompt/Approach:
enter in the website https://songstats.com/artist/legfsxq2/duki?source=overview and create a json file with the data of the artist that you can get from there

Result:
- the agent provides more info that I need so I did remove manually all the data that is not interesting for me to keep only the data we need to use. 
- 
**Learning:**
- chrome mcp is really good for data scrapping 
</pre>

Also to add the function to navigate in multiple profiles, I did create another json file called artists.json to add the data needed to navigate between them. 

With both json files created I asked to the agent to create the Types files for Typescript. 

<pre>
Goal:create TS files from json files
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:
using the duki.json file, create a type file for typescript called artist

Result:
- the agent provides the needed type with no issues

</pre>

## 4 - Creating the structure of the dashboard

I create a folder into the /app called "dashboard" also a "slug" folder to get the parameter by url and make the dashboard ready for multiple artist if needed.

NO AI used. 

## 5 - Listing available artists in dashboard at the home page

- I asked directly to the agent to create a server action in the main page to fetch the data/artists.json file and use it in the page.
<pre>
Goal:create server action to fetch data from json file
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

we are going to create a server action in a separate file, this server action should get the data from the data/artists.json file and return as array.
we are also doing a validation if the file is not present return an empty array.

and we are going to console.log the data in the start of the page

Result:
- the agent provides the needed server action in the folder app/actions as we told him in the context.md file.
- I asked the agent to modify the code from a fs.readfile to a simple import because is cleaner and not need to use fs 
</pre>

-  Now we had the data loged and we are sure the data is available. we ask the agent to render the list using the item component from shadcn

<pre>
Goal:use the data returned from the server action to render the artists list 
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

we are going to use the shadcn mcp to install the item component and we are going to use the avatar version to render all the items of the list. 

the action button should rediret us to the dashboard of that artists. 

remember to delete all the current example content first

Result:
- Agent added via pnpm the components shadcn/item and shadcn/avatar to build the list.
- also create a "separator" component that I asked to replace with the shadcn one because is not needed to create it.
- Render the infomation as needed and the button works as expected.

**Learning:**
- if I dont spcify all the components to download the agent probable would create them from scratch. I had to ask it again to download the separator in a separate prompt
- also we need to install manually radix component because shadcn mcp dont do the job.
</pre>

- With the list created We asked some quick changes to the AI while I was making sure the content is centered in the screen in all screen-sizes


# 6 - Implement theming 

With no agent I did the implementation of the theme to add light/dark mode support.

- Asked the Agent to implement the magic-ui toggle theming button using magic-ui mcp. 
<pre>
Goal:implement animated theme toggle in the layout
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

using magicui mcp install magicui/animated-theme-toggler and implement it in the layour so we can access to the button in all the pages, also please make sure to fix it at the top right

Result:
- Agent added via pnpm the components animated-theme-toggler from magic ui. 
- Agent added the feature successful as requested

</pre>

# 7- add validation on dashboard page when slug is not a valid artist
I customize the not-found page using the agent 
<pre>
Goal:create a custom 404 page
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

using magic ui mcp add @magicui/spinning-text and create a custom 404 page with a nice message with that component

Result:
- Agent added via pnpm the components animated-spinning-text
- agent create without issues the custom not found page

**Aditional changes**
- from agent created page I did some changes with spacing because the elements were too close on each others.
</pre>

# 8 - fetch data from slug and call server action to get artist data

I asked the agent to create a server action that fetch the data from a prop and pass the slug as the prop 
when null show not-found page.
<pre>
Goal:create a custom 404 page
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

for the dashboard create a server action that receive a param, this param should be the slug of the dashboard so we can fetch the data from json files dynamically with the slug.

the detailed task is:

add the server action and pass the slug as prop
in the server action, find the file with the name is equal the prop value, if not send a null.
the value obtained from the server action should be printed in the console with a console.log

Result:
- the agent tried to fetch the data using fs.fileread and I updated it with a dynamic data import
- everything else was done as expected
</pre>

# 9 - creating the grid to place the dashboard data

I decide to use a bento grid because is a good way to show multiple data in the same screen. 
used the agent to create the grid: 
<pre>
Goal:create the dashboard bento grid 
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

create in the dashboard a bento grid, responsive, every item in the grid please add it a different bg color to make sure the grid works well in all devices before we add the content to them.

we need to make sure we are making space for the next info:

large column for last releases
large and wide for a map to show listeres arount the world.
some squares for sales analytics.
you can add the text of what is expected in each bento space from now.

when we decide the bento grid distribution we are going to add the content.
Result:
- colorized bento grid ready to work
- no changes made from agent result 
</pre>

# 10 - render last releases 

with the agent help I created the last-releases component and implement it into the bento box
<pre>
Goal:Create last-releases component
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

using the shadcn mcp add the card component and implement the last releases rendered in those cards.

Result:
- the result shows the component as expected
- I had to do a little fix with the container height to make it fit with his content

</pre>

# 11 - render sales data

with the agent's help I render some values in the top 3 bento boxes using the naimation of number ticker component
<pre>

show salesData value from artist object in the 3 selected bento elements using the number ticker

Result:
- data shows as expected 
</pre>

# 12 - render fan engagements data 

- To render this data I wanted to show a map, but the map needs webgl so I want to validate that first using the agent to do the job
<pre>
Goal:validate if the browser is using webgl or not
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task: 
inside the selected bentocard we need to add a validation and show a text if the current navigator is using webgl or not, and print a message that said "is using webgl" or "is not using webgl" 

Result:
- shows validation as expected 
- 
</pre>

- now we had the validation when the webgl is not active we are going to use the component dottedmap

<pre>
Goal:when webgl is not available shows a dotted map component with the spotify listeners int he world
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

I need to install with the magicui mcp the component Dotted Map, and when the browser is not using webgl we show the dotted map.

when the webgl is active we keep showwing the message, we are going to update it later.

Result:
- The map shows as expected when webgl is not enabled.
</pre>

- now with help of the agent I create the functions to map the data and render dots on the map to show audience spots in the world
<pre>
Goal:render in the worldmaps dots in the position of the cities with the audicence is focused
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
using audienceMetrics.listenersByCity
add to the dotted map the positions and make the marker bigger based on the amount of currentMonthlyListeners

result:
- the agent create a couple of functions to map the origin data and create the object needed from the component, but they dont work I had to remove some redundant validation and the code works well. 
</pre>

- now I had the map for the users with no webgl enabled, I can add the globe map that I want.
  
<pre>
Goal:render in the worldmaps dots in the position of the cities with the audicence is focused
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

I need to install with the magicui mcp the component Globe, and when the browser is using webgl we show the globe component and render the markers

result: 
- the component was installed as expected but with big size so I made some changes to fix the responsive
</pre>

# 13 - show artist info 

As we need to show the main info I create another bento box at the top and ask help to the agent to create the profile
<pre>
Goal: show the artist basic info and social networks 
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:
now in the selected bentoCard i want to show the artist info, using his profile picture, name and social media links

Results: 
- Show info as expected but too tiny, so I update the size of the avatar and also do some changes in the mobile version to center the image and basic info. 
</pre>

<pre>
Goal: Show the followers from all platforms in a pie chart
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

modify the selected bentoCard to add a shadcn Pie chart that you can install using the shadcn cpm.

also add in the pie chart the data of the value followerBreakdown.byPlatform and add the colors of the platforms to the cart.

Result: 
- The agent did a good job but again the reponsive was not good, so I made some litle changes with paddings and sizes. 
</pre>


# 15 - global listener scroll text

- as the globes dont tell to much info I added a scroll text that show the data represented in the map at the bottom of the container
<pre>
Goal: show a scroll text with the global map info represented
AI Tool Used: copilot + GTP5

Prompt/Approach:
Following ALL the instructions into the CONTEXT.md file.

do the next task:

in the code for the dotted map or globe add at the bottom a Scroll Based Velocity installed using magicui mcp

this scroll based velocity will show the data that is showed in the map in the markers but would be scrolling in the bottom of the component

Result:
- data showed as expected but the scroll was too fast, I change the values to make it slower.
</pre>


# Reflection Questions

## AI Strategy:

- How did you decide when to use AI vs. code from scratch?
-  R: usually with logic that it takes me less time to create it than write to the agent and wait for an answer 

- Were there any tasks where AI wasn't helpful? Why?
- R: Not this time

## Code Ownership:

- How did you ensure you understood all AI-generated code?
- R: I make sure to read the generated code with the purpose of clean it because I always found unnecesary stuff or repetitive logic than can be better, and in that same work I understand what the agent write.

- Describe one piece of AI-generated code you significantly modified and why.
- the server actions, the AI generate file reader code as we are using a json file but we are using a server action so we can import directly the json with no issue so is not necesary to open the file with the fs function. 


## Productivity Impact:

- Estimate how much time AI saved you (or didn't).
- R: The work I did in 6 hours with no AI could be x3 or x4 maybe, some repetitive tasks takes too much time and also increases the chances of mistakes. 

- What would you have done differently without AI tools?
- R: I wouldn't have created the mock data from the start, I would have entered all the data hard to save time somehow, I would also have left aside many things like error handling, the customized 404 and the validation if WebGL is active or not.

## Quality Assurance:

- How did you validate AI-generated code? 
- R: I readed all the generated code trying to find code that can be better. 

- Did you catch any issues or mistakes from AI suggestions?
- R: I always give instructions to dont suggest and only follow instructions. I get some mistakes in the responses but always was from poor context in the request.
